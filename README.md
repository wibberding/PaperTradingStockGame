PaperTradingStockGame
=====================

A browser based stock trading game.

This code uses localStorage to store stock values. You have to put it all the values right now.
Sometime I plan to add the Yahoo Stock API so everything will be automatic.
Then, store data on the server side so players can compete with each other.

I'm learning and this is my first project, so feedback is appreciated.
