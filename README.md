PaperTradingStockGame
=====================

A browser based stock trading game.

This code uses localStorage to store stock values. You have to put in all the values right now.
Sometime I plan to add the Yahoo Stock API so everything will be automatic.
Then, store data on the server side so players can compete with each other and have a weekly ranking.

I'm learning and this is my first project, so feedback is appreciated.
